Upgrading the XDUOO XD05 BAL with the discreet op-amp SS2590

This project comes from my passion to find my perfect audio setup, the XDUOO XD05 BAL is a great DAC/Headphone Amp combo but lack's a little clarity , among other things with the stock op-amps installed.
I have currently tested the following discreet op-amps
Sparkos Labs SS3602
MUZG Audio Efficient JFET operational amplifier
Sparkos Labs SS2590
