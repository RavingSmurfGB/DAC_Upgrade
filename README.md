## Justification
This project comes from my passion to find my perfect audio setup, the XDUOO XD05 BAL is a great DAC/Headphone Amp combo but lacks a clarity, layering and punch; among other things with the stock op-amps installed.
I have currently tested the following discreet op-amps
* [Sparkos Labs SS3602](https://sparkoslabs.com/product/dual-discrete-op-amp-ss3602/)
* [MUZG Audio Efficient JFET operational amplifier](https://muzgaudio.com/en/produkt/efficient-jfet-operational-amplifier/)
* [Sparkos Labs SS2590](https://sparkoslabs.com/product/pro-discrete-op-amp-ss2590/)


## Discreet Op-Amps

Discreet op-amps come with a DIP-8/ 8 Pin IC Socket attached on the bottom, however the higher end units tend to come with 6 pinouts that require a breakoutboard to convert to the DIP-8.

Futhermore the amound of Discreet Op-Amps required varies by the amplifier that is used. A typical amplifier would require two Op-Amps, one for the left channel and one for the right channel allowing for stereo sound to be produced.

However a balanced amplifier works slightly differently, it sends two left channel signals and two right channel signals, each with either a positive or negative polarity. This is in a attempt to reduce noise and also increases the power which the amplifier can send to the listening device (Headphones, IEMs etc..) 
In such a implementation four Op-Amps are required.

## Testing

The breakout board that Sparkos Labs supplies required soldering, furthermore the XDUOO XD05 BAL DIP 8 sockets are very close together.

Which means that a setup such as the one below is a common sight.
