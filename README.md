## Justification
This project comes from my passion to find my perfect audio setup, the XDUOO XD05 BAL is a great DAC/Headphone Amp combo but lack's a little clarity , among other things with the stock op-amps installed.
I have currently tested the following discreet op-amps
* Sparkos Labs SS3602
* MUZG Audio Efficient JFET operational amplifier
* Sparkos Labs SS2590



## Discreet Op-Amps

Discreet op-amps come with a DIP-8/ 8 Pin IC Socket attached on the bottom, however the higher end units tend to come with 6 pinouts that require a breakoutboard to convert to the DIP-8.

Futhermore the amound of Discreet Op-Amps required varies by the amplifier that is used. A typical amplifier would require two Op-Amps, one for the left channel and one for the right channel allowing for stereo sound to be produced.

However a balanced amplifier works slightly differently, it sends two left channel signals and two right channel signals, each with either a positive or negative polarity. This is in a attempt to reduce noise and also increases the power which the amplifier can send to the listening device (Headphones, IEMs etc..)
